# Excision

Python 201. Applied Bioinformatics and Computational Biology

# Usage

Excision is developed in Python3.5 and requires it to run. If you want to use 2.7 to answer questions, that is up to you. If you don't have Python installed, the easiest place to get it is from the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).

To get started, just run:

```
python ExcisionApp.py
```
