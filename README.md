# CodeStories (Excision)

Applied Bioinformatics and Computational Biology with Python.

# What is this?

CodeStories is the most engaging and efficient way to learn basic data analysis.

The course is centered around an engaging storyline (you're a secret agent) and is broken into a series of levels.
Each level contain a primary problem which teaches you a single concept or skill.
To solve the problem, and make it to the next level, you'll write and submit code, which will be automatically validated.
If you initially canâ€™t solve the problem, a series of optional tasks are available for each level.
You can complete tasks to receive a hint related to the main problem.

# Who is this for?

CodeStories is for STEM professionals who want to take back control of their data.
This particular course is for life scientist who have a basic understanding of programming in Python, but don't feel comfortable using it in their day-to-day.
You should be comfortable with:

* variables and data types (e.g. strings)
* control flow (e.g. while loops)
* basic data structures (e.g. lists)
* functions

## What we'll cover

# How do I use it?

CodeStories is developed in Python3.5 and requires it to run. If you don't have Python installed, the easiest place to get it is from the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).

To get started, just run:

```
python ExcisionApp.py
```
